# Activity Recognition Library
This library provides Android developers with tools to recognize user activities using sensor data.

## Features

- __Activity Recognition:__ Recognize physical activities performed by the user.
- __Utilization of Accelerometer:__ Utilize the smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer for accurate activity detection.
- __Real-time Recognition:__ Provide immediate feedback on user activities in real-time.
- __Flexible Integration:__ Easily integrate into Android projects.
- __User-Friendly Interface:__  Offers a clear interface and comprehensive documentation for easy adoption.

## Installation

Add the library dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
implementation 'fi.juka:activity-recognition-library:1.0.0'
```

Make sure to include maven  `url 'https://jitpack.io'` in your settings.gradle file:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
## Usage Examples
### Accelerometer
To utilize the accelerometer and gather activity data from it, you need to create an activity that implements the AccelerometerListener interface. For example:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), AccelerometerListener {

    private lateinit var acceleration: FloatArray
    private lateinit var accelerometer: Accelerometer

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // Initialize the accelerometer and register the listener
        this.accelerometer = Accelerometer(this)
        accelerometer.register(this)
    }

    override fun onAccelerationChanged(acceleration: FloatArray) {
        // Handle new accelerometer data here as needed
        this.acceleration = acceleration
    }

    override fun onAccelerationChanged(acceleration: FloatArray) {
        // Filtered acceleration data
        this.acceleration = accelerometer.filter(acceleration)
    }

    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        // Re-register the listener when the activity comes to the foreground
        accelerometer.register(this)
    }

    override fun onPause() {
        super.onPause()
        // Unregister when the activity goes to the background
        accelerometer.unregister()
    }
}
```
In this MainActivity class, the AccelerometerListener interface is implemented, allowing the reception of accelerometer data. In the onCreate() method, the accelerometer is initialized and the listener is registered. The onResume() and onPause() methods ensure that the listener is properly registered and unregistered during the activity's lifecycle, allowing you to handle new accelerometer data as needed. 

I recommend you to filter acceleration data using the filter method because it helps remove the effects of gravity from the raw accelerometer readings. By applying a low-pass filter with a smoothing factor (alpha), the filter function separates gravitational acceleration from the overall acceleration.

That's all for registering the accelerometer and getting data from it!

### Database

It's up to you how you would like to save your acceleration data. The only requirement is that you must use the TrainingData class for successful data comparison. Here's how the TrainingData class looks like:
```
class TrainingData(
    val id: Long,
    val x_axis: Float,
    val y_axis: Float,
    val z_axis: Float,
    val total_acceleration: Float,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val activityId: Long
) {
}
```
Where
__id__ represents a unique identifier for each acceleration data,
__x_axis__, __y_axis__, and __z_axis__ indicate the acceleration values along the respective axes,
__total_acceleration__ denotes the overall acceleration value,
__timestamp__ signifies the time when the acceleration data is recorded, and
__activityId__ associates with the activity represented by the acceleration data.

I have a database package ready for use, and you can utilize it along with its methods as per your preference. You can find the documentation here.

### Data comparision

DataComparer class preprocesses the activity data before comparison. Then, it compares real-time average accelerations to preprocessed training data to identify the user's performed activity. For example: 

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        // example data
        val trainingData = mapOf(
            1L to listOf(
                TrainingData(1, 1.2F, 0.5F, 0.6F, 0.0F, 0, 1),
                TrainingData(2, 1.4F, 0.6F, 0.5F,0.0F, 0,  1)
            ),
            2L to listOf(
                TrainingData(3, 3.5F, 2.1F, 2.4F,0.0F, 0,2),
                TrainingData(4, 4.0F, 2.3F, 2.4F,0.0F, 0, 2)
            ),
            3L to listOf(
                TrainingData(5, 2.0F, 1.8F, 2.5F,0.0F, 0,3),
                TrainingData(6, 1.5F, 1.6F, 2.0F,0.0F, 0,3)
            )
        )

        // Context initialization
        val dataComparer = DataComparer(this)

        // Preprocessing the activity data
        dataComparer.preprocessing(
            listOf(
                Pair(1L, "Walking"),
                Pair(2L, "Cycling"),
                Pair(3L, "Running")
            ),
            trainingData
        )

        // Test real-time total average acceleration
        val realTimeTotAvrgAcc = 1.47

        // Comparing real-time total average acceleration with preprocessed activity data
        dataComparer.compareDataAverages(realTimeTotAvrgAcc) { recognizedActivity ->
            Log.d("Activity test", "Recognized Activity: $recognizedActivity")
        }
    }
}
```
Here, example data is created from training data for different activities such as walking, cycling, and running. This training data is passed to the DataComparer class.

[!NOTE]
data comparer currently doesn't require total acceleration or timestamp, so you can set them as 0 for now

As you can see from the example, in data comparison, it is necessary to compare the average total accelerations of real-time acceleration values with previously stored acceleration data to use the comparison. You can use the AccelerationDataBuffer class to assist with this. You can either use it by buffering data with a predetermined buffer size:

```kotlin
AccelerationDataBuffer(bufferSize = 20)
```
Or use it for temporarily storing and removing data, as shown in the following example:
```kotlin
override fun onAccelerationChanged(acceleration: FloatArray) {
    var accData = accelerometer.filter(acceleration)

    accelerationBuffer.addData(
        Triple(accData[0].toDouble(), accData[1].toDouble(), accData[2].toDouble()),
        System.currentTimeMillis()
    )
        
    val currentData = accelerationBuffer.getData()
    
    if (currentData.size == 20) {
        val x = currentData.map { it.first.first }
        val y = currentData.map { it.first.second }
        val z = currentData.map { it.first.third }
        val time = currentData.map { it.second }

        val averageTotalAcceleration = 
        AccelerationUtils.calculateAverageTotalAcceleration(x,y,z)

        comparision.compareDataAverages(averageTotalAcceleration) { activityName ->
            if (activityName != null && activityName.isNotEmpty()) {
                // Do something with "$activityName"
            }
        }
        accelerationBuffer.emptyData()
    }
}
```
